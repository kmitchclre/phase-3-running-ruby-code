# The p method will output the data in a nicer format by calling the .inspect method on our data.

# Ruby has one more method, pp, for "pretty-printing" complex data, such as nested arrays and hashes (the Ruby equivalent of a JavaScript object)

# nil means no value, like null in JS

# puts method always returns nil

# In Ruby, it's convention to use underscores (_) to separate words in variables. This is referred to as snake case (as opposed to camel case, which is the convention in JavaScript).
